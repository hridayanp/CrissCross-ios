# Criss Cross 🎮  
A simple **Tic-Tac-Toe (X/O)** game built using **SwiftUI**. The game features an AI opponent that plays optimally using a strategic move selection algorithm.

## 📌 Features  
✔️ **Single-player mode** with AI opponent  
✔️ **AI Move Strategy**  
   - Wins if possible  
   - Blocks the opponent if necessary  
   - Takes the center square if available  
   - Picks a random move as a last resort  
✔️ **Smooth SwiftUI UI**  
✔️ **Responsive design** for all screen sizes  

## 🛠️ How It Works  
The AI makes decisions based on the following logic:  
- It first checks if it can win in the current move.  
- If not, it tries to block the opponent’s winning move.  
- If neither of those is possible, it prioritizes taking the center square.  
- As a last resort, it selects a random available position.
